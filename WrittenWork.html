<h2>Where The Mind Is Without Fear</h2>
<span style="cursor:crosshair">
<p>
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high<br>
Where knowledge is free<br>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br>
By narrow domestic walls<br>
Where words come out from the depth of truth<br>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br>
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br>
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br>
Into ever-widening thought and action<br>
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.<br>

<h2>Unending Love</h2>
<span style="cursor:crosshair">
<p>
I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…<br>
In life after life, in age after age, forever.<br>
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,<br>
That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,<br>
In life after life, in age after age, forever.<br>
<br><br>
Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,<br>
Its ancient tale of being apart or together.<br>
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,<br>
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:<br>
You become an image of what is remembered forever.<br>
<br><br>
You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.<br>
At the heart of time, love of one for another.<br>
We have played along side millions of lovers, shared in the same<br>
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-<br>
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.<br>
<br><br>
Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you<br>
The love of all man’s days both past and forever:<br>
Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.<br>
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –<br>
And the songs of every poet past and forever.<br>

<h2>Freedom</h2>
<span style="cursor:crosshair">
<p>
Freedom from fear is the freedom<br>
I claim for you my motherland!<br>
Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,<br>
breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning<br>
call of the future;<br>
Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith<br>
you fasten yourself in night's stillness,<br>
mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;<br>
freedom from the anarchy of destiny<br>
whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,<br>
and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.<br>
Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,<br>
where movements are started through brainless wires,<br>
repeated through mindless habits,<br>
where figures wait with patience and obedience for the <br>
master of show,<br>
to be stirred into a mimicry of life.<br>
